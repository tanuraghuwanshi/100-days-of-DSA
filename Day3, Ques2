// You are given an array arr[] of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. Your task is to identify and return the missing element.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    int arr[n-1];
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    int total = n * (n + 1) / 2;
    int missing = total - sum;
    printf("%d\n", missing);
    return 0;
}
